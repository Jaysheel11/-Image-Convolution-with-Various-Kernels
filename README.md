# Image-Convolution-with-Various-Kernels



This code performs image convolution using different kernels, such as edge detection, blur, sharpening, and more, to enhance or modify images. It demonstrates the application of convolution in image processing and provides visual comparisons between the original and filtered images.


The requirements for running this code are as follows:

Python: The code is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed on your system.

Libraries: The code requires the following libraries to be installed: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and os. These libraries are commonly used for scientific computing and image processing tasks.

Image File: You need to have an image file in JPEG format (with the filename "yourimage.jpg") located in the same directory as the script. The code will read and process this image.

Ensure that you have the necessary Python environment set up with the required libraries installed and an image file available before running the code.
